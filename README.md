# PHYS339-LAB02
### Abstract
In this lab we calibrated Aduino Uno at pin 9 and got a linear relationship between analog input and output voltage with Measured Voltage $V_m= (0.019789 \pm 0.000006) V \times$ Analog Input Value $+ (0.0055 \pm 0.0009) V$. By converting voltages back to Analog input, we observed the input pin A0 and A1 has similar characteristics. We also checked the duty cycle of the Arduino and checked two low pass filters (RC filters) by varying the output pin between 9 and 10. We observed the cyan triangle-shaped signal with pin 9 and the curved wave signal with pin 10. Then with pin 10, we measured the time constant for the RC circuit, and the time constant is $2.574 \pm 0.009 s$. At the end of this experiment, we used uniform distribution to simulate a candle using RGB-LED.
